abstract = {Due to its fast and simple applicability, clone-and-own is widely used in industry to develop software variants. In cooperation with different companies for thermoelectric products, we implemented multiple variants of a heat monitoring tool based on clone-and-own. After encountering redundancy-related problems during development and maintenance, we decided to migrate towards a software product line. Within this paper, we describe this case study of migrating cloned variants to a software product line based on the extractive approach. The resulting software product line encapsulates variability on several levels, including the underlying hardware systems, interfaces, and use cases. Currently, we support monitoring hardware from three different companies that use the same core system and provide a configurable front-end. We share our experiences and encountered problems with cloning and migration towards a software product line---focusing on feature extraction and modeling in particular. Furthermore, we provide a lightweight, web-based tool for modeling, configuring, and implementing software product lines, which we use to migrate and manage features. Besides this experience report, we contribute most of the created artifacts as open-source and freely available for the research community.},
